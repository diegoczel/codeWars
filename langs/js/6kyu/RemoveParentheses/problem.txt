Remove the parentheses
In this kata you are given a string for example:

"example(unwanted thing)example"
Your task is to remove everything inside the parentheses as well as the parentheses themselves.

The example above would return:

"exampleexample"
Notes
Other than parentheses only letters and spaces can occur in the string. Don't worry about other brackets like "[]" and "{}" as these will never appear.
There can be multiple parentheses.
The parentheses can be nested.

"example (unwanted thing) example", "example  example")
"a (bc d)e", "a e"
"a(b(c))", "a"

"hello example (words(more words) here) something", "hello example  something"

"(first group) (second group) (third group)", "  "

example (unwanted thing) example
a (bc d)e
a(b(c))
hello example (words(more words) here) something
(first group) (second group) (third group)
((()))
((()()))
()
